# Fitrbit

A small package containing some convenient wrappers for interacting with the fitbit api.

Functions like `getHr` can retrieve a whole day's worth of second-resolution heartrate data.

In addition there is an html widget and accompanying shiny module for tagging activities over multiple day and returning those tags to R.
