\title{Grabs both heartrate and steps for a given date at 1 minute intervals.}
\usage{
getActivitiesList(date = NULL, dateDirection = "before", count = 100,
  premade_link = NULL, token)
}
\arguments{
\item{date}{Character string of date in yyyy-MM-dd format e.g. ("2017-07-31"). If no date is given defaults to the current date.}

\item{dateDirection}{Do you want to look for activities 'before' the supplied date, or 'after'? E.g. Give me 100 activities before april 1.}

\item{count}{How many activities do you want to get? Note that if value is greater than 100 multiple calls to the api will be completed and the amount of activities returned will be in increments of 100 due to how the fitbit api handles repeated requests.}

\item{premade_link}{Do you already have a query link? Otherwise one will be generated for you using the above paramters. This is for when you have retrieved a query already and are using the supplied \code{$next_link} value to get more results.}

\item{token}{Valid OAuth token for the fitbit api. Make sure you have requested the activities scope!}
}
\value{
A dataframe with columns "activeDuration": how many seconds the activity took,"activityName": fitbit name for whatever activity you did, "averageHeartRate": average heart rate during activity, "duration": how many seconds the activity lasted, "heartRateLink": link that can be used to query api for heart rate time series for this activity, "startTime": start date and time of activity; and however many rows the query returned.

A list with a dataframe \code{$activities_list} which contains columns "activeDuration": how many seconds the activity took,"activityName": fitbit name for whatever activity you did, "averageHeartRate": average heart rate during activity, "duration": how many seconds the activity lasted, "heartRateLink": link that can be used to query api for heart rate time series for this activity, "startTime": start date and time of activity; and however many rows the query returned. In addition, the list contains \code{$next_link} which is a link to get the next batch of activities from the api if you desire more than the 100 most recent.
